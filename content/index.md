## Session 1 (7/13/24)

The story begins in [[Galgeback]] at a tavern called the [[Rusty Axe]]. Two city guards enter the tavern and demand for the [[rebels]] to be surrendered. [[Wemet]], [[Urvard]] and [[Qilnoch]] quickly defeat one guard causing the other to surrender, while [[Krartar]] looks on curiously. 

Most of the tavern staff immediately begin to board up the windows and doors. [[Krartar]] begins to help, but fails hilariously, impaling himself on a shard of wood. Enraged, he begins breaking some of the boards until the front door gets destroyed by a large number of guards wielding a battering ram. 

As the guards begin to pour into the tavern, they begin demanding the surrender of rebels, while killing several unruly patrons indiscriminately. They declare everyone in the tavern to be under arrest, and bring them to a holding cell. After some time,[[ Urvard]] finds a shiv and a spork (spork borg) #joke #equipment

After a few hours of [[Silly Sam]]'s musical nonsense, the guards bring a group of 12 people to a courtroom. The [[judge]] seems to be very quick at handing out death sentences, as a few prisoners begin to be executed on the spot. 

As it approaches [[Wemet]]'s turn to plead, [[Krartar|Kratar]] uses an ability to cause the judge to be confused.  After some deliberation, the [[Bailiff]], not sensing any foul play gives the Borgers the chance to redeem themselves if they travel to [[Lothold]] and find a rumored [[Medicine Man]] who knew the cure for the [[Goblin Curse]]. [[Silly Sam]] explains that the Goblin curse essentially boils down to getting bit by a goblin will turn you into a goblin.

Our [[Quests|quest]] is to go to [[Origin]], report to the [[High Priestess]] and then go to [[Lothold]] to find the [[Medicine Man]], then return with the knowledge of how to cure the [[Goblin Curse]]. 

As the Borgers leave [[Galgeback]], the gates close behind them. They are not allowed to return to the city until they've completed their quest.

### Day 1 of Travel to [[Lothold]]

The group begins traveling down an old trade road that has fallen into disrepair. As they make camp, they come to find some food as been spoiled and some has been stolen by wild beasts.

### Day 2 of Travel to [[Lothold]]

The group comes across an [[abandoned graveyard]]. [[Krartar]] Misinterprets [[Urvard]]'s growling as excitement to check out the graveyard. As we approach the chapel, [[Silly Sam]] begins playing a song by the legendary Bard Troupe, Fall Out Borg. #joke 

Hearing moaning sounds below us, the group travels into the basement, where they are quickly attacked by a group of Zombies. [[Krartar]] summons zombies to join the battle, unbeknownst to the party, as he continues to try to blend in. As the zombies are defeated, with nobody seemingly permanently harmed, the group makes camp in the Chapel for the night.

### Day 3 of Travel to [[Lothold]]

We see a glow in the distance. [[Krartar]] ties up the zombies far out of eyeshot, and the group approaches what ends up being [[Lothold]]. The party notes that the fields are rather blighted and scarce. The locals appear to be setting up a large bon fire for some reason. Some of them have sacks with eyes cut out over their head. 

As we enter town, a [[young girl]] approaches [[Wemet]] asking if he is "here for a wedding," then asking if he is the groom. He lies, saying he is the Groom's father, which is quickly found out. She insists that he is her groom, but thinking quickly, he asks about a medicine man, suggesting that he is feeling rather ill and wouldn't want anything bad to happen during the wedding. She seems to know about him.
